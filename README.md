# About
Built by Alix Cave
System: HTC Vive Pro
Time: This project took about 3 weeks of active developement.
Pro: I appreciate that the structure assets (fan, board, ramp, trampoline) were provided since asset creation beyond basic shapes is a whole other task.
Con: While I did eventually figure out how to implement the 'wind' from the fan, I wish there had been some guidance there as it required the most time to figure out and doing so is a seperate topic than the rest of the previous lessons.

## Versions
- Unity 2017.2.0f3
